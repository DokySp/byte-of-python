> I am writing this email to thank you for the great help your book has done for me! It was a really good book that I enjoyed thoroughly. As a 15 year old who has never done programming before, trying to learn Python online was difficult and I couldn't understand anything. But I felt like your book gave was much easier to understand and eased me into the whole new world of programming. Thanks to you, I can now write a high level language with ease. I thought programming would be hard and boring, but with your book's help, I realised how fun and interesting yet simple it can be! I would like to thank you again for your hard work on helping out beginners like me. -- [Prottyashita Tahiyat](mailto:protahiyat@gmail.com) on Sep 17, 2019

> 저에게 매우 큰 도움이 되어 감사하다는 메일을 쓰고 있습니다. 이 책은 정말 좋은 책이에요! 제가 아직 프로그래밍이라는 것을 모르던 15살 때, 인터넷에서 파이썬을 배우는 것은 매우 힘들었고, 전 어떠한 것도 이해하기가 힘들었어요. 하지만 저는 이 책이 다른 책보다 훨씬 쉽게 이해할 수 있게 해주는 것같이 느꼈고, 완전히 새로운 프로그래밍이라는 세계에 손쉽게 들어갈 수 있게 해주었어요. 이제는 손쉽게 High level 언어를 사용할 수 있게 해주셔서 감사합니다. 저는 예전에 프로그래밍이 어렵고 지루한 것이라 생각했었지만, 이 책의 도움을 받고 난 후 프로그래밍이라는 것이 얼마나 간단하고 재미있으며 흥미로운 것인지 알게 되었어요! 다시 한 번 저 같은 초심자를 도외줄 수 있는 이러한 책을 제작해주셔서 감사하다는 말씀 드리고 싶습니다. -- [Prottyashita Tahiyat](mailto:protahiyat@gmail.com) on Sep 17, 2019

Thank you so much. -- Madhura

> I am a 18 year old IT student studying at University in Ireland. I would like to express my gratitude to you for writing your book "A Byte of Python", I already had knowledge of 3 programming langagues - C, Java and Javascript, and Python was by far the easiest langague I have ever learned, and that was mainly because your book was fantastic and made learning python very simple and interesting. It is one of the best written and easy to follow programming books I have ever read. Congratulations and keep up the great work. -- Matt

> I am a student from China, Now ,I have read you book A byte of Python, Oh it's beautiful. The book is very simple but can help all the first learnners. You know I am interesting in Java and cloud computing many times, i have to coding programm for the server, so i think python is a good choice, finish your book, i think its not only a good choice its must use the Python. My English is not very well, the email to you, i just wanna thank you! Best Wishes for you and your family. -- Roy Lau

> I recently finished reading Byte of Python, and I thought I really ought to thank you. I was very sad to reach the final pages as I now have to go back to dull, tedious oreilly or etc. manuals for learning about python. Anyway, I really appreciate your book. [Samuel Young](mailto:sy137@gmail.com)

> Dear Swaroop, I am taking a class from an instructor that has no interest in teaching. We are using Learning Python, second edition, by O'Reilly. It is not a text for beginner without any programming knowledge, and an instructor that should be working in another field. Thank you very much for your book, without it I would be clueless about Python and programming. Thanks a million, you are able to _break the message down_ to a level that beginners can understand and not everyone can. -- [Joseph Duarte](mailto:jduarte1@cfl.rr.com)

> I love your book! It is the greatest Python tutorial ever, and a very useful reference. Brilliant, a true masterpiece! Keep up the good work! -- Chris-André Sommerseth

> First of all, I want to say thanks to you for this greate book. I think it is a good book for those who are looking for a beginner's tutorial for Python. It is about two or there years ago, I think, when I first heard of this book. At that time, I am not able to read some book in English yet, so I got a chinese translation, which took me into the gate of Python programming. Recently, I reread this book. This time, of course, the english version. I couldn't believe that I can read the whole book without my dictionary at hand. Of course, it all dues to your effort to make this book an easy-to-understand one. -- [myd7349](https://github.com/swaroopch/byte_of_python/pull/13)

> I'm just e-mailing you to thank you for writing Byte of Python online. I had been attempting Python for a few months prior to stumbling across your book, and although I made limited success with pyGame, I never completed a program. Thanks to your simplification of the categories, Python actually seems a reachable goal. It seems like I have finally learned the foundations and I can continue into my real goal, game development. ... Once again, thanks VERY much for placing such a structured and helpful guide to basic programming on the web. It shoved me into and out of OOP with an understanding where two text books had failed. -- [Matt Gallivan](mailto:m_gallivan12@hotmail.com)

> I would like to thank you for your book _A Byte of Python_ which i myself find the best way to learn python. I am a 15 year old i live in egypt my name is Ahmed. Python was my second programming language i learn visual basic 6 at school but didn't enjoy it, however i really enjoyed learning python. I made the addressbook program and i was sucessful. i will try to start make more programs and read python programs \(if you could tell me source that would be helpful\). I will also start on learning java and if you can tell me where to find a tutorial as good as yours for java that would help me a lot. Thanx. -- [Ahmed Mohammed](mailto:sedo_91@hotmail.com)

> A wonderful resource for beginners wanting to learn more about Python is the 110-page PDF tutorial A Byte of Python by Swaroop C H. It is well-written, easy to follow, and may be the best introduction to Python programming available. -- [Drew Ames](http://www.linux.com/feature/126522)

> Yesterday I got through most of Byte of Python on my Nokia N800 and it's the easiest and most concise introduction to Python I have yet encountered. Highly recommended as a starting point for learning Python. -- [Jason Delport](http://paxmodept.com/telesto/blogitem.htm?id=627)

> Byte of Vim and Python by @swaroopch is by far the best works in technical writing to me. Excellent reads \#FeelGoodFactor -- [Surendran](http://twitter.com/suren/status/12840485454)

> Before I started to learn Python, I've acquired basic programming skills in Assembly, C, C++, C\# and Java. The very reason I wanted to learn Python is it's popular \(people are talking about it\) and powerful \(reality\). This book written by Mr. Swaroop is a very good guide for both brand-new programmers and new python programmers. Took 10 half days to go through it. Great Help! -- [Fang Biyi \(PhD Candidate ECE, Michigan State University\)](mailto:fangbiyi@gmail.com)

> Thank you ever so much for this book!! This book cleared up many questions I had about certain aspects of Python such as object oriented programming. I do not feel like an expert at OO but I know this book helped me on a first step or two. I have now written several python programs that actually do real things for me as a system administrator. They are all procedural oriented but they are small by most peoples standards. Again, thanks for this book. Thank you for having it on the web. -- Bob

> I just want to thank you for writing the first book on programming I've ever really read. Python is now my first language, and I can just imagine all the possibilities. So thank you for giving me the tools to create things I never would have imagined I could do before. -- "The Walrus"

> I wanted to thank you for writing _A Byte Of Python_ \(2 & 3 Versions\). It has been invaluable to my learning experience in Python & Programming in general. Needless to say, I am a beginner in the programming world, a couple of months of self study up to this point. I had been using youtube tutorials & some other online tutorials including other free books. I decided to dig into your book yesterday, & I've learned more on the first few pages than any other book or tutorial. A few things I had been confused about, were cleared right up with a GREAT example & explanation. Can't wait to read \(and learn\) more!! Thank you so much for not only writing the book, but for putting it under the creative commons license \(free\). Thank goodness there are unselfish people like you out there to help & teach the rest of us. -- Chris

> I wrote you back in 2011 and I was just getting into Python and wanted to thank you for your tutorial "A Byte of Python". Without it, I would have fallen by the wayside. Since then I have gone on to program a number of functions in my organization with this language with yet more on the horizon. I would not call myself an advanced programmer by any stretch but I notice the occasional request for assistance now from others since I started using it. I discovered, while reading "Byte" why I had ceased studying C and C++ and it was because the book given to me started out with an example containing an augmented assignment. Of course, there was no explanation for this arrangement of operators and I fell on my head trying to make sense of what was on the written page. As I recall it was a most frustrating exercise which I eventually abandoned. Doesn't mean C or C++ is impossible to learn, or even that I am stupid, but it does mean that the documentation I worked my way through did not define the symbols and words which is an essential part of any instruction. Just as computers will not be able to understand a computer word or computer symbol that is outside the syntax for the language being used, a student new to any field will not grasp his subject if he encounters words or symbols for which there are no definitions. You get a "blue screen" as it were in either case. The solution is simple, though: find the word or symbol and get the proper definition or symbol and lo and behold,the computer or student can proceed. Your book was so well put together that I found very little in it I couldn't grasp. So, thank you. I encourage you to continue to include full definitions of terms. The documentation with Python is good, once you know, \(the examples are its strength from what I see\) but in many cases it seems that you have to know in order to understand the documentation which to my mind is not what should be. Third party tutorials express the need for clarification of the documentation and their success largely depends on the words that are used to describe the terminology. I have recommended your book to many others. Some in Australia, some in the Caribbean and yet others in the US. It fills a niche no others do. I hope you are doing well and wish you all the success in the future. -- Nick

> hey, this is ankush\(19\). I was facing a great difficulty to start with python. I tried a lot of books but all were bulkier and not target oriented; and then i found this lovely one, which made me love python in no time. Thanks a lot for this "beautiful piece of book". -- Ankush

> I would like to thank you for your excellent guide on Python. I am a molecular biologist \(with little programming background\) and for my work I need to handle big datasets of DNA sequences and to analyse microscope images. For both things, programming in python has been useful, if not essential to complete and publish a 6-years project. That such a guide is freely available is a clear sign that the forces of evil are not yet ruling the world! :\) -- Luca

> Since this is going to be the first language you learn, you should use A Byte of Python. It really gives a proper introduction into programming in Python and it is paced well enough for the average beginner. The most important thing from then on will be actually starting to practice making your own little programs. -- ["{Unregistered}"](http://www.overclock.net/t/1177951/want-to-learn-programming-where-do-i-start#post_15837176)

> Just to say a loud and happy _thank you very much_ for publishing "A Byte of Python" and "A Byte of Vim". Those books were very useful to me four or five years ago when I starting learning programming. Right now I'm developing a project that was a dream for a long, long time and just want to say _thank you_. Keep walking. You are a source of motivation. All the best. -- Jocimar

> Finished reading A byte of Python in 3 days. It is thoroughly interesting. Not a single page was boring. I want to understand the Orca screen reader code. Your book has hopefully equipped me for it. -- Dattatray

> Hi, 'A byte of python' is really a good reading for python beginners. So, again, NICE WORK! i'm a 4 years experienced Java&C developer from China. Recently, i want to do some work on zim-wiki note project which uses pygtk to implement. i read your book in 6 days, and i can read and write python code examples now. thx for your contribution. plz keep your enthusiasm to make this world better, this is just a little encourage from China. -- Lee

> I am Isen from Taiwan, who is a graduating PhD student in Electrical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University. I would like to thank you for your great book. I think it is not only just easy to read but also comprehensive and complete for a new comer of Python. The reason I read your book is that I am starting to work on the GNU Radio framework. Your book let me catch most of important core ideas and skill of Python with a minimum time. I also saw that you do not mind that readers send you a thank note in your book. So I really like your book and appreciate it. Thanks. -- [Isen I-Chun Chao](mailto:chao926@gmail.com)
